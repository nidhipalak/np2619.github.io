## About me!


I earned my BS from The City College of New York and MPH from Mount Sinai.  I currently work at Columbia in research and can't wait to implement R in my workplace. 

My first introduction to public health was an undergrad internship with HealthLeads.  As part of my MPH, I traveled to Uganda to understand and address knowledge gaps in HPV immunizations and cervical cancer screenings. 

I am an active volunteer. My favorite organizations are Hole in the Wall Gang Camp and New York City Hemophilia Chapter.
