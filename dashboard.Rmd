### Top 3 Food violations by borough

```{r}

  filter(boro != "Missing",
         grade %in% c("A", "B", "C")) %>% 
  group_by(boro, violation_description) %>%

### How many inspections are done by zipcode?
```{r}
zip = rest %>% 
  filter(boro == "MANHATTAN") %>%

  plot_ly(x = ~zipcode, y = ~n, type = "scatter", color = ~n, colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(yaxis = list(title = "number of inspections"))

zip
```


### How do scores align with grades?

```{r}
boxscore = rest %>% 
  select(grade, score, cuisine_description) %>% 
  drop_na(score, grade) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~score, color = ~grade, type = "box", 
          text = ~cuisine_description, colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "grade"))
