## About this site

This site is intended for homework 4 of P8105, a class on data science. It was made in RStudio and hosted on github. All the code information can be found by clicking on the github icon on the top right!


## Resume

I earned my BS from The City College of New York and MPH from Mount Sinai.  I currently work at Columbia in research and can't wait to implement R in my workplace. 

My first introduction to public health was an undergrad internship with HealthLeads.  As part of my MPH, I traveled to Uganda to understand and address knowledge gaps in HPV immunizations and cervical cancer screenings. 

I am an active volunteer. My favorite organizations are [Hole in the Wall Gang Camp](https://www.holeinthewallgang.org/) and [New York City Hemophilia Chapter](https://www.nyhemophilia.org/).


## About me!

Welcome to my very first website (excluding the ones we made in class)! My name is Nidhi, I grew up in Westchester and am very stressed about this election. I have an older sister and a puppy named Nova!

Here's a pic of Nova!!
