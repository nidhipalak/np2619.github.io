My first introduction to public health was an undergrad internship with HealthLeads.  As part of my MPH, I traveled to Uganda to understand and address knowledge gaps in HPV immunizations and cervical cancer screenings. 

I am an active volunteer. My favorite organizations are [Hole in the Wall Gang Camp](https://www.holeinthewallgang.org/) and [New York City Hemophilia Chapter](https://www.nyhemophilia.org/).
