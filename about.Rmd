## About me!

Welcome to my very first website (excluding the ones we made in class)! My name is Nidhi, I grew up in Westchester and am very stressed about this election. I have an older sister and a puppy named Nova! I love to play tennis and golf, and championing "Fire Gettleman" and "Houston Asterisks" movements.

I earned my BS from The City College of New York and MPH from Mount Sinai.  I currently work at Columbia in research and can't wait to implement R in my workplace. 

My first introduction to public health was an undergrad internship with HealthLeads.  As part of my MPH, I traveled to Uganda to understand and address knowledge gaps in HPV immunizations and cervical cancer screenings. 

I am an active volunteer. My favorite organizations are Hole in the Wall Gang Camp and New York City Hemophilia Chapter.
