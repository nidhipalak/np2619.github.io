## About me!

Welcome to my very first website (excluding the ones we made in class)! My name is Nidhi, I grew up in Westchester and am very stressed about this election. I have an older sister and a puppy named Nova! I love to play tennis and golf, and championing "Fire Gettleman" and "Houston Asterisks" movements.  

Here's a pic of Nova!!
